Chain 1 Exception: gp_exp_quad_cov: sigma is 0, but must be positive! (in '/var/tmp/pbs.33626.pbs/RtmpC1ZCKY/model-26206272a557f2.stan', line 51, column 4 to column 135)
Chain 1 If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
Chain 1 but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
